## My Preparation Plan 1


### Evening or Night
- After class check your hand written notes and read it and understand
- After understanding make the detail notes you like 
- Important make short notes
- if you don't understand do some research about that and make a doubt notes and please try to ask the mentor

### Morning
- Review what you studied and try to look before today's lecture.
