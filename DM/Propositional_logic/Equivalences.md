## Propostional Equivalences

Note that we will use the term “compound proposition” to refer to an expression formed from propositional variables using logical operators, such as p ∧ q.

### Definations 

**Tautology**
> A Compound proposition that is `always true`, No matter what the `truth table values` of the propostional variable that occurs in it, is called a *Tautology*

**Contradiction**
>A compound proposition that is `always false` is called *Contradiction*

**Contingency**
>A compound propostion that is neither a `Tautology nor  a Contradiction` is called Contingency

**Satisfiability**
> Here it should contain `atleast One True result` in its truth table
> example Conjection(AND) it at least contain one True result

**Unsatisfiability**
> Here we `cannot find even one single True Value` in the truth table

**valid**
> If a proposition is `tautalogy then it is valid`

**Invalid** 
> if a proposition is `Contradiction or Contingency`


Tautologies and contradictions are often important in mathematical reasoning.

### Example

1. We can construct examples of tautologies and contradictions using just one propositional variable. Consider the truth tables of `p ∨ ¬p` and `p ∧ ¬p` . Because p ∨ ¬p is always true, it is a tautology. Because p ∧ ¬p is always false, it is a contradiction.

## Logical Equivalences

Compound propositions that have the `same truth values in all possible cases` are called logically equivalent

### Defination
> The compound propositions p and q are called logically equivalent if p<=>q is a tautology.
> 
> The notation p ≡ q denotes that p and q are logically equivalent.

Remark: The symbol ≡ is not a logical connective, and p ≡ q is not a compound proposition
but rather is the statement that p <=> q is a tautology. The symbol ⇔ is sometimes used instead
of ≡ to denote logical equivalence.


### Famous Logical Equivalences:

T -> True, F -> False

1. **Identity Laws**
>(a) P ∧ T ≡ P
>(b) P ∨ F ≡ P


2. **Domination Laws**
> (a) P ∨ T ≡ T
> (b) P ∧ F ≡ F

3.  **Idempotent Laws**
> (a) P ∨ P ≡ P
> (b) P ∧ P ≡ P

4. **Double Negation Laws**
> ¬(¬P) ≡ P
