### Defination
>Given a set S, the power set of S is the set of all subsets of the set S. The power set of S is denoted by P(S). 
>
>Every Combination of Set A is Subset of A 
>We can Determine no. of element is power set the is $2^n$ where n is number element in given set

### Example
1 What is the power set of the set {0, 1, 2}?
>
>Solution: The power set P ({0, 1, 2}) is the set of all subsets of {0, 1, 2}. Hence,
>Note that the empty set and the set itself are members of this set of subsets.
>
>P ({0, 1, 2}) = {∅, {0}, {1}, {2}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 2}, {0, 1, 2}}.
>$2^3 = 8$ elements

2 What is the power set of the empty set? What is the power set of the set {∅}?
>Solution: The empty set has exactly one subset, namely, itself. Consequently, 
>P (∅) = {∅}.
>The set {∅} has exactly two subsets, namely, ∅ and the set {∅} itself. Therefore,
>P ({∅}) = {∅, {∅}}.
>$2^1 = 2$ elements
