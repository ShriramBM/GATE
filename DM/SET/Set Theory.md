#### Defination 1:
A set is an unordered collection of objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is
said to contain its elements. We write a ∈ A to denote that a is an element of the set A. The
notation a  not ∈ A denotes that a is not an element of the set A.

### some notes
>- A set is a **`Well-defined `** collection of **`Distinct object`**
>- Sets are used to group objects together
>- Set denoted using Uppcase letters
>- Elements of sets denoted using Lowercase letters
>- one way is like roster method
>- Sometimes the roster method is used to describe a set without listing all its members

### How to describe: 
>one way is like roster method
>the notation {a, b, c, d} represents the set with the four elements a, b, c, and d.
>
 >Examples
>1. The set V of all vowels in the English alphabet can be written as V = {a, e, i, o, u}.
>2. The set O of odd positive integers less than 10 can be expressed by O = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.
>3. Although sets are usually used to group together elements with common properties, there is
>nothing that prevents a set from having seemingly unrelated elements. For instance, {a, 2, Fred, New Jersey} is the set containing the four elements a, 2, Fred, and New Jersey.


>Another way to describe a set is to use `set builder` notation
>
>Example
>1. The set of positive integers less than 100 can be denoted by {1, 2, 3, . . . , 99}.
>But using set builer notation we can write
>
>O = {x | x is an odd positive integer less than 100},
>$$or$$ 
>O = {$x ∈ Z^+$ | x is odd and x < 100}.
>
>--> Note We often use this type of notation to describe sets when it is impossible to list all the elements of the set.
>
>2. the set $Q^+$ of all positive rational numbers can be written as
> $Q^+$  =  {x ∈ R | x = p/q , for some positive integers p and q}.

### Important role in Discrete mathematics are:

1. N = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}, the set of **natural numbers**
2. Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}, the set of **integers**
3. $Z^+$ = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, the set of **positive integers**
4. Q = {p/q | p ∈ Z, q ∈ Z, and q != 0}, the set of **rational numbers**
5. R, the set of **real numbers**
6. $R^+$ , the set of **positive real numbers**
7. C, the set of **complex numbers**

### Intervals symbols
1. $[a,b] =$ {$x|a<=x<=b$}
2. $[a,b)=$ {$x|a<=x<b$}
3. $(a,b] =$ {$x|a<x<=b$}
4. $(a,b) =$ {$x|a<x<b$}

### My satisfaction 
>Note that the concept of a datatype, or type, in computer science is built upon the
>concept of a set. In particular, a datatype or type is the name of a set

>For example, boolean is the name of the set {0, 1} together with operators on one or more elements of this set, such as AND, OR,
>and NOT.

### Some proof
Showing Two Sets are Equal To show that two sets A and B are equal, show that A ⊆ B
and B ⊆ A.
