Sets are used extensively in counting problems, and for such applications we need to discuss
the sizes of sets.

### Defination for Finite set 
>Let S be a set. If there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, we say that S is a finite set and that n is the cardinality of S. The cardinality of S is denoted by |S|.
>
>Let Break down the defination like
>*S* = { *n*-distinct elements } where *n* is +ve int == Finite set
>- *S* is finite set and That *n* is Cardinality(size) of *S*
>- The cardinality of S is denoted by |S|.

### Examples

1. Let A be the set of odd positive integers less than 10. Then |A| = 5.
2. Let S be the set of letters in the English alphabet. Then |S| = 26.
3. Because the null set has no elements, it follows that |âˆ…| = 0.

### Defination for Infinite Set
>A set is said to be infinite if it is not finite.

### Example 
1. The set of positive integers is infinite.

------> We will extend the notion of cardinality to infinite sets in Section 2.5(Book), a challenging topic full of surprising results.
