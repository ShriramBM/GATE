- AVL tree is a BST
- It should balanced i.e height of left subtree - height of right subtree = {-1, 0, 1}

In AVL tree Balance Factor (k) = height (left(k)) - height (right(k)) is very important and in AVL tree the 

In AVL tree the complexity will always be $Olog(n)$ 

AVL 
- best time complexity  = $Olog(n)$
- worst time complecity = $Olog(n)$

BST 
- best time complexity  = $Olog(n)$
- worst time complecity = $O(n)$
