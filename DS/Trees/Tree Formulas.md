### 1. How many Edges

>For every `N nodes their will be N - 1  edges`. For reference [[Trees Terminalogy]]

### 2.   How many nodes at certain levels
>   $number..of..nodes..at..that..level = 2 ^ {level}$ . refer [[Binary Tree]]

### 3. Total number of nodes for given height both Max And Min
>$MaxTotalNodes = 2^{h+1}-1$
>$MinTotalNodes = h+1$ 
>refer [[Binary Tree]]

### 4. Max or Min height of the tree by given N Max or Min nodes
> here we are finding the height of the tree 
> Min_height -> {$h+1 = log_2(n+1) - 1$}  <=> min_height of max_nodes of tree
> Max_height -> {$h=n-1$} <=> max_height of min_nodes of tree
> refer [[Binary Tree]]
